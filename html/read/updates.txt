<center><i>All Function development placed on hold, Alpha stage postponed.
Upgrade from HTTP/1.0 to HTTP/1.1 in progress. Nothing changes untill this is finished.
What is HTTP/1.1, and Why is it needed? -- Simply put, its majorly superiour in many ways.
First and foremost, a connection with HTTP/1.0 must close and re-open with every transmission.
With HTTP/1.1 a connection stays open untill it is no longer needed, therfore much more efficent.</i></center>
