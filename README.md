NEctroverse Relaunch!
========
This code is currently under hardcore redevelopment and is not stable.

I repeat... this code is UNSTABLE!!!


NEctroverse is a recode of the game Ectroverse.
It contains a lot of changes from the original code.

You can play the current Ectroverse at http://www.ectroverse.org
You can find the original source code at https://github.com/ectroverse


To install the game:
Edit config.h and change the directory line at the top...
Folder location does not matter, as long as you have write permissions.
The program is set to auto-create needed directories.

While your there in config.h
Change the default Admin username and password! =)


Run:
* make 
* ./evserver

Yup, that's it... nothing else to run here. =P
Map creation is now embeded into the core.

-- NEctroverse can run in forked daemon mode, which does not require a shell.

The server by default is on port 9122. This can be changed in config.h

KNOWN BUGS - Very annoying and need to go:
* Many, code was unstable when obtained.


NEctroverse is currently unavalible.
