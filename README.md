NEctroverse Relaunch!
========
This code is currently under hardcore redevelopment and is not stable.


I repeat... this code is UNSTABLE!!!


To install the game:
Edit config.h and change the directory line at the top...
Folder location does not matter, as long as you have write permissions.

While your there in config.h
Change the default Admin username and password! =)


Run:
* make map | make
* ./map
* ./evserver

-- NEctroverse is a forked damon server, and does not requre a shell once iniated.

Congrats, the server is running on port 9122 of your localhost.

KNOWN BUGS - Very annoying and need to go:
* Merge Fleet does not work. Splitting does.
* ... ?


You can play the current Ectroverse at http://www.ectroverse.org

NEctroverse is currently unavalible.
