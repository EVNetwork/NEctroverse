NEctroverse Relaunch!
========
This code is currently under hardcore redevelopment and is not stable.


I repeat... this code is UNSTABLE!!!

!!DO NOT USE!!

To install the game:
Edit config.h and change the directory lines at the bottom to your Ectroverse folders.
While your there, change the default Admin username and password! =)


Run:
* make map | make
* ./map
* ./evserver

-- NEctroverse is a forked damon server, and does not requre a shell once iniated.

Congrats, the server is running on port 9122 of your localhost.

KNOWN BUGS - Very annoying and need to go:
* Merge Fleet does not work. Splitting does.
* ... ?


You can play the current Ectroverse at www.ectroverse.org.
