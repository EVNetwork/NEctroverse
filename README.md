NEctroverse Relaunch!
========
This code is currently under hardcore redevelopment and is not stable.


I repeat... this code is UNSTABLE!!!


To install the game:
Edit config.h and change the directory line at the top...
Folder location does not matter, as long as you have write permissions.
The program is set to auto-create needed directories.

While your there in config.h
Change the default Admin username and password! =)


Run:
* make 
* ./evserver

Yup, that's it... nothing else to run here. =P
Map creation is now embeded into the core.

-- NEctroverse can run in forked daemon mode, which does not require a shell.

Congrats, the server is running on port 9122 of your localhost.
Or if you want... you can change the port in config.h also.
Most variable config is done in there now.

KNOWN BUGS - Very annoying and need to go:
* Merge Fleet does not work. Splitting does.
* ... ?


You can play the current Ectroverse at http://www.ectroverse.org

NEctroverse is currently unavalible.
