All faults must be reported... No matter how minor.

If you encounter a bug/error do not abuse it.
Report it.

If unsure how to avoid a bug/error.
And try logging out/in again.

If you still encounter an bug/error please check on IRC
or send a e-mail with as much possible detail

I am often on IRC while working on the code, while I may not reply instantly.
If I'm there, I'll get it. (Eventully :P)
