<a name="a0"><b><i>0. So, what is NEctroverse?</i></b></a>
<br>
Briefly, NEctroverse is a massive multi-player game, where players compete for dominance over the galaxy resources.
<br>
NEctroverse is a continuation of Ectroverse a game created by Maloeran, it was one of his first works that I know of.
<br>
Maloeran hasn't done any direct work on Ectroverse for many years, although he has recently provided several segments of code now in use.
<br>
And as always Maloeran continues to be a great source of advice, providing many pointers which have made current development possible!
<br>
The code/game has been developed since then by various other people along the ages. And now rests with the current team.
<br>

<br>
<a name="a1"><b><i>1. Who is in the current team?</i></b></a>
<br>
<a href="mailto:necro@nectroverse.net">Necrolgan</a>, Host, Senior Administrator and Coder.
<br>
<a href="mailto:eva@ectroverse.org">EVA</a>, Game Administrator
<br>
 
<br>
<a name="a3"><b><i>2. What language was NEctroverse written in?</i></b></a>
<br>
NEctroverse is a server program itself, listening to the port, handling http requests, with its own database.
<br>
It was written in C for Linux, but could easily compile on other UNIX platforms with a few minor modifications ( for those who are still not sure, no, it doesn't compile or run on windows ).
<br>

<br>
<a name="a4"><b><i>3. Why did you not use perl/php/jsp/etc.?
<br>
</i></b></a>Well, simply when this game "project" was first created it was in C, so I'm not about to go changing the whole thing that much. Senoir Administration has recently upgraded the server protocalls
<br>
Which means we now support HTTP/1.1 alongside the old-slow HTTP/1.0 (for those that have no choice, or just prefer old skool), this includes the expansion to multi-threads and HTTPS functions.
<br>

<br>
<a name="a5"><b><i>4. Fine, where's the source code?</i></b></a>
<br>
<a href="https://github.com/EVNetwork">Here is the list of all avalible sources</a>, list maintained by Necrolgan.
<br>
<a href="http://evnetwork.github.io/NEctroverse/">Here is the current NEctroverse source code</a>, as maintained by Necrolgan.
<br>
I want to warn any potential source reader : there is no comments or documentation, and some parts of the code are especially messy. Good luck, and have fun! =)
<br>

<br>
<a name="a6"><b><i>5. Can I run my own galaxy?</i></b></a>
<br>
Sure, all you need comes with the source. On the other hand... all this is not documented in any way. So good luck.
<br>

<br>
<a name="a7"><b><i>6. What are the requirements for running a galaxy or a modified version of EV?</i></b></a>
<br>
The hardware requirements? Depending on features enabled, the usage starts at about 60mb. But can increase sizably upto about 400mb with enabled HTTPS &amp; mySql and running 4 threads.
<br>
A decent speed internet connection, a static IP and any Unix based operating system would also be required. The number of threads you can run depends on your CPU core count.
<br>
The code has been written to automatticly detect the count of physical cores (not their virtual cores), and allocate a number of threads based on this. I suggest leaving this as is. (Unless you lower it)

<a name="b0"><b><i>0. Where is the guide for the game?</i></b></a>
<br>
No "official" guide has been written. You'll probably find something online, almost lost through the ages.
<br>

<br>
<a name="b1"><b><i>1. What are the rules?</i></b></a>
<br>
At the moment, there is only a very small set of rules, just to make sure the game is enjoyable for everybody.
<br>
- Owning more than one account or logging in other empires than yours is not allowed.
<br>
- Harassing players is not tolerated, in forums or through in-game messages, this includes cuss words in any language.
<br>
- Language used in the game and family pictures must not be of a discriminatory, racist, sexist or sexual nature.
<br>
- Any bugs encountered must be reported, and not abused.
<br>
Players breaking the rules will get a warning, an account deletion or a permanent ban. Rules are subject to change.

<a name="c0"><b><i>0. How come the feature xyz is not yet implemented? When will it be?</i></b></a>
<br>
There are several new features planned for NEctroverse which have not been implemented, yet.
<br>
A time of delivery cannot be given.
<br>

<br>
<a name="c1"><b><i>1. Why can't we have customizable races?</i></b></a>
<br>
In my opinion, races should exist to encourage teamwork between family members, as working with other players surely make the game more interesting. Though, I really don't want over-specialized races, as all custom ones would be ; these would force players to adopt a very specific way of playing without being able to change their role during the round, any non-specialized race would then also be non-optimal ( and therefore, never used ). New players who didn't make a such "perfect" race would also be penalized the whole round.
<br>

<br>
<a name="c2"><b><i>2. Why are empires not ranked by Networth instead of planets count?</i></b></a>
<br>
Networth rankings would encourage players to stockpile and attempt to reach the higher networth as possible for the end of the round, which is somewhat uninteresting. On the other hand, rankings based on planet counts tend to generate some large wars before the end of the round as families try to gather as many planets as possible.

<br>
This is not really a problem related to NEctroverse, but to the browser you are using. It occurs only with Internet Explorer ( or the AOL thing ), the program decides to stop requesting up-to-date pages from the server and display previously cached ones instead. A known solution, I heard, is to delete the cache files. Another solution would be to upgrade your browser to <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/" target="_blank">Mozilla</a> or <a href="http://www.opera.com/" target="_blank">Opera</a>. It could also be caused by a bad proxy, ignoring http headers and caching files.

Computers count from zero, so does Maloeran... And he wrote the game from scratch. So, You better get used to it.
