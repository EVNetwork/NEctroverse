Facebook base link almost completed, this will enable login/registration from FB account.
I have to write the interface from scratch, because some of what I'm doing "isn't possible" :P
And I have found no existing API's for Plain C, so teething issues are to be expected.

Population growth formula changed, its now based on existing population... so the larger it gets the faster it grows.

Well, that was epic... The server has now been upgraded to full HTTP/1.1 support.
Hopefully you will all see it paying off with improved load/responce times :)

<div class="center"><i>All Function development placed on hold, Alpha stage postponed.
Upgrade from HTTP/1.0 to HTTP/1.1 in progress. Nothing changes untill this is finished.<br>
What is HTTP/1.1, and Why is it needed? -- Simply put, its majorly superiour in many ways.
First and foremost, a connection with HTTP/1.0 must close and re-open with every transmission.
With HTTP/1.1 a connection stays open untill it is no longer needed, therfore much more efficent.</i></div>

When... well, I'm not exactly sure yet. I'm still recoding quite a few things.
